# Tasks and Threads Demo
App to compare running the Fibonacci sequence recursively synchronously, asynchronously, using the await keyword, and with threads to solve the problem and compare the performance of these methods.

Because the calculation for the Fibonacci sequence is so trivial, the more asynchronous the code is, the worst the performance actually is. Setting up threads for each recursion makes the performance here atrocious.
